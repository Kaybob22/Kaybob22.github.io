      <h3>Audience Profile</h3>
      <p>
        I am looking for business owners who are looking to start promoting
        their company online. These will tend to be older and more mature
        audiences. Most will be less technicalogically inclined, so my wording
        needs to be professional, yet easy to read.
      </p>

      <h3>Marketing Plan</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Promote my web design through social media. Follow hashtags and groups
          looking for site design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue reaching out to former clients. My business currently is by
          word of mouth, I need to be sure my former clients are still happy!
        </li>
        <li>Build a personal website</li>
        <li>Get business cards</li>
        <li>
          Refer people to my new github site for examples of past work while I
          create my own site.
        </li>
